* I'm currently working on an app that brings local communities together and allows people to leverage the power of community and crowdsourcing to get information and learn from others.

* I am continuing to learn more about everything ReactJS can do, as well as explore other coding languages such as Python.

* I'm looking to join a team where I can help bring products to life that help users do what they need to/want to do easier. I have a passion for developing products that are designed with the user in mind and make their lives easier.
